# HTML-CSS-side-project
This is a project I am using to learn the basics of HTML & CSS.
I am using a video from YouTube to teach me everthing I am applying to my code. I will link the video below.

By the end of the video, I would have learned how to create a mock YouTube page from scratch without copying any code.
Nothing I add into my code is copied exact. I try my best to mimic the CSS styling from YouTube without copying and pasting code.
